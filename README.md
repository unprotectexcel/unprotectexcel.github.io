# Unprotect Excel

Per Microsoft’s own documentation, Excel workbook / worksheets protection were not designed as a security feature ( https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/protection-and-security-in-excel-be0b34db-8cb6-44dd-a673-0b3e3475ac2d ), and this may be the reason why Google Sheets ignores all those protections while importing protected Excel to their program.

This project tries to simulates how Google Sheets opens Excel with protected Workbook or Worksheets, and is my first Swift MacOS program developed using Xcode.

This program is written in Swift 5.2 for MacOS, with SSZipArchive library written in Objective-C / C.
